## Fitting a Curve to Synthetic Data

Using `TensorFlow.js` and `p5js` to fit a curve to a synthetic dataset.

This example uses TensorFlow.js to build a model and learn its coefficients. The basic idea is very similar to the tutorial `Fitting a Curve to Synthetic Data` which is a part of the official TFJS documentation but this specific implementation is different in many aspects.

To run the code locally, you need the following dependencies installed:

- Node.js version 8.9 or higher
- NPM CLI

$ git clone https://github.com/atorov/ml-tfjs-fitting-curve
$ cd ml-tfjs-fitting-curve
$ npm i
$ npm start
